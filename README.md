Project Overview:
The Air Canvas project is an innovative application that enables users to draw and paint on a digital canvas using hand gestures detected by a webcam or camera. 
Leveraging advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system interprets the user’s hand movements and translates them into strokes on the canvas.
Additionally, the system features character recognition capabilities, allowing it to recognize and interpret written characters or symbols drawn in the air.

Key Features:
Hand Gesture Detection: Uses computer vision techniques to identify and track the user’s hand in real-time.
Drawing and Painting: Translates hand movements into strokes of varying color and thickness on a digital canvas.
Character Recognition: Employs machine learning models to recognize characters drawn in the air and convert them into text.
User Interface: A simple and interactive interface for users to start, pause, and clear their drawings.

Potential Challenges:
Ensuring accurate hand detection and tracking in varying lighting conditions.
Minimizing latency to provide real-time drawing feedback.
Achieving high accuracy in character recognition with diverse handwriting styles.

Future Enhancements:
Adding multi-touch support for recognizing gestures involving both hands.
Incorporating gesture-based commands for additional functionalities.
Expanding character recognition to support multiple languages.
